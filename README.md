# Booleans-and-Selections-
This is Module 8 Python Lab activities we worked with Booleans and conditional statements.
This week we learned about Logical Operators, Nested Conditions, Chained Conditions, and Booleans fucntions.
The Logical Operators work with "AND" "OR" and "NOT" functions in order to check a def function if the the function is "False" or "True" and then printing the statement that corresponds with it. 
Nested Conditions work the same way by having if else statements and inside there are other if else statements making.
Next, Chained Condions work like Nested conditions but instead it uses the "elif" whcih stands for "else if" which is another way of having the def functions check every statement before finding which one is True. 
Lastly, Booleans functions all work cohesively to make a code work together,
